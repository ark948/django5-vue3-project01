1. initial frontend setup
    frontend> npm init vue@latest .
    > project name: frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev

    delete components folder
    completely clean App.vue
    clear everything in assets/main.css except the import at the top

2. adding router
    npm install vue-router
    1. create a router instance inside router folder
    2. the root path will be using HomeView as component option (although it isn't a component but a view)
    3. export the router
    4. register the router in main.js
    5. use router link in App.vue

3. adding home view (as same time as router, router needs at least one component)
    create views folder, components folder, styles folder
    create a HomeView folder in views

4. adding register feature
    register feature will have a component that will render the registration form
    no need for a seperate registerView, it can be rendered in home view
    register form done,
    bind input values to state variable (we use v-model to quickly achieve this...)
    (instead of manully get the event target value)
    (althou i want to see what happens if we don't)
    (quick idea, let's just create a test post request)
    (check if csrf_token is there)
    testuser02@gmail.com-Max-Payne-home123*
    fixed huge problem: for data with multiple parts use reactive instead of ref
    use ref for primitive data structures like int and string
    done - may need some small cleaning
    after successful registration, navigate to otp email verification page
    for that, use router.push({name: ''}) (import the router object)

5. adding a test connection - GET (ok)
    create a new component called GetData.vue
    this component will get some sample data from backend using axios
    and will be rendered in home
    process:
    component added,
    path added,
    link in HomeVue,
    create view in backend: done + url
    need to install axios, done
    adding .env file with backend api address and port in it
    creating axios config in api.js
    need to configure cors in backend
    the url in env not working

6. adding a test connection - POST
    first version without using state variable (ok)
    second version using reactive variables (ok)

7. fixing axios api baseURL
    fixed baseURL, trailing slash was required

8. Email verification process:
    small problem...
    after successful registration, we are automatically recirected to email verification page
    this makes successful registration message moot.
    need a way to display kind of a floating notification message
    adding vue3-notification package by @kyvg
    > npm install --save @kyvg/vue3-notification
    add it to main.js
    add global component to App.vue
    done, but looks terrible and i have not been able to customize it.
    version 2 is better
