permission and throttling policies can use credentials to determine if request should be permitted.

request.user -> contrib.auth's -> User class

request.auth

Note: Don't forget that authentication by itself won't allow or disallow an incoming request, it simply identifies the credentials that the request was made with.

(NOTE: this topic is closely related to permissions)

The authentication schemes are always defined as a list of classes. REST framework will attempt to authenticate with each class in the list, and will set request.user and request.auth using the return value of the first class that successfully authenticates.

if no class authenticates, request.user = django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser
and request.auth = None

authentication schemes can be set in DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES setting (globally) or per-view using authentication_classes.
