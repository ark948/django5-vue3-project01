django uses unittest, class based approach.

when tests are ran, all files beginning with 'test_' will be selected as test files.

to cancel running a test 'gracefully', press ctrl+c once. (gracefully: will wait for the current test to complete.)
twice will exit and halt the testing process immeidately.

tests that require a database: a temporary database will be created, that can be heavily modified.

order of tests: all TestCase tests will run first. then any other django-based tests (e.g. SimpleTestCase...)
then any other unittest.TestCase

if tests are properly isolated, they can be ran in parallel to improve speed, using test --parallel option

the default password hasher is slow by design, if many users exists in test, use a custom one.
